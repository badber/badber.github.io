I am a 3rd-year PhD student working on stochastic economic optimization for
electricity networks.

My research aims to facilitate a cost-effective integration of renewables energies.
More specifically, I focus on obtaining dynamic-security conditions and
implementing them into optimization problems as constraints. The challenge comes
from mapping the differential-equation-driven dynamics into algebraic
constraints, all while achieving computational efficiency for the stochastic optimization.

My supervisors are Prof. Goran Strbac and Dr. Fei Teng, and I am part of the
Control &amp Power Research Group at Imperial College London.
